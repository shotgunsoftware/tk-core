    """
    An object representation of a file-close event.
    
    The event holds a :meth:file_path property, indicating which open file or 
    document the event is referring to. In engine implementations which
    integrate with MDI applications, the path is required in order to 
    distinguish which document is being closed.

    In engine implementations where the current file isn't known, well defined
    or accessible, a None value should be returned to indicate this.

    Note that the file_path may represent a document that has not yet been 
    saved. In this case, it may not be a full path but instead the name of the
    document, for example "untitled" or an empty string "". The event 
    information should transparently reflect whatever is returned from the 
    underlying application.
