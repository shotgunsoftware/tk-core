        Displays or updates a global "busy window" tied to this engine. The window

        This is currently an internal method and not meant to be be used by anything
        outside the core API. Later on, as things settle, we may consider exposing this.
        
        This method pops up a splash screen with a message and the idea is that 
        long running core processes can use this as a way to communicate their intent
        to the user and keep the user informed as slow processes are executed. If the engine
        has a UI present, this will be used to display the progress message. If the engine
        does not have UI support, a message will be logged. The UI always appears in the 
        main thread for safety.

        Only one global progress window can exist per engine at a time, so if you want to 
        push several updates one after the other, just keep calling this method.
        
        When you want to remove the window, call clear_busy().

        Note! If you are calling this from the Core API you typically don't have 
        access to the current engine object. In this case you can use the 
        convenience method tank.platform.engine.show_global_busy() which will
