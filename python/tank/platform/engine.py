        Displays or updates a global "busy window" tied to this engine. The window
        is a splash screen type window, floats on top and contains details of what
        is currently being processed.

        This method pops up a splash screen with a message and the idea is that
        long running core processes can use this as a way to communicate their intent
        to the user and keep the user informed as slow processes are executed. If the engine
        has a UI present, this will be used to display the progress message. If the engine
        does not have UI support, a message will be logged. The UI always appears in the
        main thread for safety.

        Only one global progress window can exist per engine at a time, so if you want to
        push several updates one after the other, just keep calling this method.

        When you want to remove the window, call :meth:`clear_busy()`.

        Note! If you are calling this from the Core API you typically don't have
        access to the current engine object. In this case you can use the
        convenience method ``tank.platform.engine.show_global_busy()`` which will

    def register_command(self, name, callback, properties=None):
        """
        Register a ``command`` with a name and a callback function.

        A *command* refers to an access point for some functionality.
        In most cases, commands will appear as items on a Shotgun dropdown
        menu, but it ultimately depends on the engine - in the Shell engine,
        commands are instead represented as a text base listing and in the
        Shotgun Desktop it is a scrollable list of larger icons.

        .. note:: This method is used to add menu entries for launching
           toolkit UIs. If you wish to register a panel UI with toolkit,
           you need call this method in order to register a menu command
           with which a user can launch the panel. In addition to this,
           you also need to call :meth:`register_panel` in order to
           register the panel so that the engine can handle its
           management and persistence.

        An arbitrary list of properties can be passed into the engine
        in the form of a properties dictionary. The interpretation of
        the properties dictionary is engine specific, but in general
        the following properties are supported:

        - ``short_name`` - A shorter name, typically intended for console use (e.g. 'import_cut')

        - ``icon`` - A path to a 256x256 png app icon. If not specified, the icon for the app will be used.

        - ``description`` - a one line description of the command, suitable for a tooltip.
          If no description is passed, the one provided in the app manifest will be used.

        - ``title`` - Title to appear on shotgun action menu (e.g. "Create Folders")

        - ``type`` - The type of command - hinting at which menu the command should appear.
          Options vary between engines and the following are supported:

            - ``context_menu`` - Supported on all engines. Places an item on
              the context menu (first item on the shotgun menu). The context menu is a
              suitable location for utility items, helpers and tools.

            - ``panel`` - Some DCCs have a special menu which is accessible only when
              right clicking on a panel. Passing ``panel`` as the command type hints
              to the system that the command should be added to this menu. If no panel
              menu is available, it will be added to the main menu. Nuke is an example
              of a DCC which supports this behavior.

            - ``node`` - Node based applications such as Nuke typically have a separate
              menu system for accessing nodes. If you want your registered command to appear
              on this menu, use this type.


        **Grouping commands into collections**

        It is possible to group several commands into a collection. Such a collection is called
        a *group*.  For example, you may have three separate commands to launch Maya 2017,
        Maya 2016 and Maya 2015, all under a 'Launch Maya' group. It is up to each engine to
        implement this specification in a suitable way but typically, it would be displayed as a
        "Launch Maya" menu with three sub menu items to represent each version of Maya.

        Each group has a concept of a group default - this is what would get executed if you click
        on the 'Launch Maya' group.

        To register commands with groups, pass the following two parameters in the properties
        dictionary:

        - ``group`` - The name for a group this command should be considered a member of.

        - ``group_default`` - Boolean value indicating whether this command should represent the
          group as a whole.

        .. note:: It is up to each engine to implement grouping and group defaults in an
                  appropriate way. Some engines may not support grouping.


        The following properties are supported for the Shotgun engine specifically:

        - ``deny_permissions`` - List of permission groups to exclude this
          menu item for (e.g. ``["Artist"]``)

        - ``deny_platforms`` - List of platforms for which not to show the menu
          (e.g. ``["windows", "mac", "linux"]``). Please note that there are
          other ways to achieve this same result.

        - ``supports_multiple_selection`` - a special flag that allows multiple objects
          in Shotgun to be selected and operated on. An example showing how to write a
          multi select shotgun app is provided in a special branch in the sample starter
          app: https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-multi-starterapp/tree/shotgun_multi_select

        - Please note that custom icons are not supported by the Shotgun engine.

        Typical usage normally looks something like this -
        register_command is called from the :meth:`Application.init_app()` method of an app::

            self.engine.register_command(
                "Work Area Info...",
                callback,
                {"type": "context_menu", "short_name": "work_area_info"}
            )

        :param name: Name of the command. This will be the key when accessed via the
                     :meth:`commands` dictionary.
        :param callback: Callback to call upon command execution

        be used in conjunction with a register_command call.

        a saved layout. Apps wanting to be able to take advantage of the persistence given by
        these saved layouts will need to call register_panel as part of their init_app phase.

        **Notes for engine developers**

        Qt dialog & widget management can be quite tricky in different engines/applications.
        Because of this, Sgtk provides a few overridable methods with the idea being that when
        developing a new engine, you only need to override the minimum amount necessary.

        Making use of these methods in the correct way allows the base Engine class to manage the
        lifetime of the dialogs and widgets efficiently and safely without you having to worry about it.

        The methods available are listed here in the hierarchy in which they are called::

            show_dialog()/show_modal()
                _create_dialog_with_widget()
                    _get_dialog_parent()
                    _create_widget()
                    _create_dialog()

        For example, if you just need to make sure that all dialogs use a specific parent widget
        then you only need to override _get_dialog_parent() (e.g. the tk-maya engine).
        However, if you need to implement a two-stage creation then you may need to re-implement
        show_dialog() and show_modal() to call _create_widget() and _create_dialog() directly rather
        than using the helper method _create_dialog_with_widget() (e.g. the tk-3dsmax engine).
        Finally, if the application you are writing an engine for is Qt based then you may not need
        to override any of these methods (e.g. the tk-nuke engine).

        :param title: The title of the window. This will appear in the Toolkit title bar.
        :param bundle: The app, engine or framework object that is associated with this window
