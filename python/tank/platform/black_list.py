"""
In rare cases, a core update may break or cause instability to apps and engines.
This is typically when an app has inadvertently been 'taking advantage' of a 
bug or where improvements in for example error handling which causes undesired 
side effects in apps. 

While these situations should be very rare, it is still worth tracking them in the core
so that we at least can give a heads up warning when we know that something is going
to cause future friction.
