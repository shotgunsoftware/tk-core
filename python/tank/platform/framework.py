        When a framework is shared, a single copy of the code is shared
        across all apps that use it. All apps will cut their framework
        instances from the same code. Any global state within the framework
        will be shared across all framework instances, and hence across all
        different apps.

        If your framework manages complex global state that you want to control
        precisely, it may be useful to set the framework to be not shared in
        the ``info.yml`` manifest file. This will ensure that each bundle that
        uses the framework will maintain it's own private version of the
        framework code.
