        Special import command for Toolkit bundles. Imports the python folder inside

        Each Toolkit App or Engine can have a python folder which contains additional
        code. In order to ensure that Toolkit can run multiple versions of the same app,
        as well as being able to reload app code if it changes, it is recommended that
        this method is used whenever you want to access code in the python location.

        For example, imagine you had the following structure::

            tk-multi-mybundle

                   \- tk_multi_mybundle

        The above structure is a standard Toolkit app outline. ``app.py`` is a
        light weight wrapper and the python module
        ``tk_multi_myapp`` module contains the actual code payload.

        name of the method you want to execute and the accompanying arguments. 
        Toolkit will find the correct hook file based on the currently configured 
        setting and then execute the specified method.

        Hooks form a flexible way to extend and make toolkit apps or engines configurable.
        A hook acts like a setting in that it needs to be configured as part of the app's
        configuration, but instead of being a simple value, it is a code snippet contained
        inside a class.

        Apps typically provide default hooks to make installation and overriding easy.
        Each hook is represented by a setting, similar to the ones you access via
        the :meth:`get_setting()` method, however instead of retrieving a fixed value,
        you execute code which generates a value.

        This method will execute a specific method for a given hook setting. Toolkit will
        find the actual python hook file and handle initialization and execution for you,
        by looking at the configuration settings and resolve a path based on this.

        Arguments should always be passed in by name. This is to make it easy to add new
        parameters without breaking backwards compatibility, for example
        ``execute_hook_method("validator", "pre_check", name=curr_scene, version=curr_ver).``
