        Return the location for the specified bundle within the specified section of the parent yml
        data block.

        .. note:: The absolute_location should be True or False depending on
            what it is the caller intends to do with the resulting location
            returned. In the situation where the descriptor for the bundle
            is to be updated to a new version, it is ctitical that the location
            returned by this method be the yml file and associated tokens
            housing the concrete descriptor dictionary. The goal is to ensure
            that the new descriptor contents are written to the same yml file
            where the old descriptor is defined, rather than what might be
            an included value from another yml file. A good example is how
            engines are structured in tk-config-basic, where the engine instance
            is defined in a project.yml file, but the engine's location setting
            points to an included value. In the case where absolute_location
            is True, that include will be followed and the yml file where it
            is defined will be returned. If absolute_location were False, the
            yml file where the engine instance itself is defined will be returned,
            meaning the location setting's include will not be resolved and
            followed to its source. There is the need for each of these,
            depending on the situation: when a descriptor is going to be
            updated, absolute_location should be True, and when settings other
            than the descriptor are to be queried or updated, absolute_location
            should be False. In some cases these two will return the same
            thing, but that is not guaranteed and it is entirely up to how
            the config is structured as to whether they are consistent.

        :param schema: A schema defining types and defaults for settings.
        :param settings: A dict of settings to sparsify.
        :param engine_name: The name of the current engine
        :param manifest_file: The path to the manifest file if known.

            using a non-default value.
