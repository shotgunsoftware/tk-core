    """
    Factory method that creates a :class:`SoftwareLauncher` subclass
    instance implemented by a toolkit engine in the environment config
    that can be used by a custom script or toolkit app. The engine
    subclass manages the business logic for DCC executable path
    discovery and the environmental requirements for launching the DCC.
    Toolkit is automatically started up during the DCC's launch phase.
    A very simple example of how this works is demonstrated here::

        >>> import subprocess
        >>> import sgtk
        >>> tk = sgtk.sgtk_from_path("/studio/project_root")
        >>> context = tk.context_from_path("/studio/project_root/sequences/AAA/ABC/Light/work")
        >>> launcher = sgtk.platform.create_engine_launcher(tk, context, "tk-maya")
        >>> software_versions = launcher.scan_software()
        >>> launch_info = launcher.prepare_launch(
        ...     software_versions[0].path,
        ...     args,
        ...     "/studio/project_root/sequences/AAA/ABC/Light/work/scene.ma"
        ... )
        >>> subprocess.Popen([launch_info.path + " " + launch_info.args], env=launch_info.environment)

    where ``software_versions`` is a list of :class:`SoftwareVersion`
    instances and ``launch_info`` is a :class:`LaunchInformation`
    instance. This example will launch the first version of Maya
    found installed on the local filesystem, automatically start
    the tk-maya engine for that Maya session, and open
    /studio/project_root/sequences/AAA/ABC/Light/work/scene.ma.

        versions. See the :class:`SoftwareLauncher` for more info.

        for globbing files. It will then replace the tokens in the template with the regular expressions
