Some notes about this stylesheet
------------------------------------------------

This stylesheet is meant to be used in conjunction with a QPalette
which contains the key colours and shades of gray that Maya 2014 is
using - with one exception -- the selection color has been changed
to match our "Shotgun Blue".

The strategy is to run a clean plastique style with a QPalette on top
of that. QT unfortunately seem to contain a number of cases where the Palette
isn't properly picked up by widgets or families of widgets.

This is where this style sheet comes into play: This is used to work around
and augment those places where the palette isn't being properly respected.

    /*
    This is the font that is bundled with core. This implies that any
    apps that use the dark look and feel will use this font by default.

    /*
    Maya uses an 11px font size throughout.
    Note that QLabels with <small> or <big> tags
    will scale accordingly around this baseline size.

    resolve this
