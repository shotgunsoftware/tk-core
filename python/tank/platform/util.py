    Running change_context will attempt to change the context the engine and
    its apps are running in on the fly. The current engine must accept the
    context change, otherwise a full restart of the engine will be run instead.

    The determination of whether an engine supports context changing comes from
    its "context_change_allowed" property. If that property returns True, then
    the context change will be allowed to proceed. If it returns False, then
    the engine's "change_context" method will raise
    :class:`TankContextChangeNotSupportedError`, which will then trigger a restart of
    the engine and all of its apps.

    In the event that the engine does support context changes, any apps that
    support context changing will do so, as well. Any that do not will themselves
    be restarted within the new context.

    The benefit of supporting context changes in engines and apps is speed. The
    end result of this routine should be identical to that of a restart, but
    will require less time to complete.
