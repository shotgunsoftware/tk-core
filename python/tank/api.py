        This is useful if you want to get a list of files matching a particular
        template and set of fields. One common pattern is when you are dealing
        with versions, and you want to retrieve all the different versions for a
        file. In that case just resolve all the fields for the file you want to operate
        on, then pass those in to the paths_from_template() method. By passing version to
        the ``skip_keys`` parameter, the method will return all the versions associated
        with your original file.

        Any keys that are required by the template but aren't included in the fields
        dictionary are always skipped. Any optional keys that aren't included are only
        skipped if the ``skip_missing_optional_keys`` parameter is set to True.

        If an optional key is to be skipped, all matching paths that contain a value for
        that key as well as those that don't will be included in the result.

        pattern matching, trying to avoid doing a thousand file lookups for a
        thousand frames in a sequence.

        It works exactly like :meth:`paths_from_template` with the difference
        that any field marked as abstract in the configuration will use its
        default value rather than any matched file values. Sequence
        fields are abstract by default.

        .. note:: The result is not ordered in any particular way.

        Imagine you have a template ``render: sequences/{Sequence}/{Shot}/images/{eye}/{name}.{SEQ}.exr``::

            >>> import sgtk
            >>> tk = sgtk.sgtk_from_path("/studio/my_proj")
            >>> render = tk.templates["render"]

        All fields that you don't specify will be searched for. So if we want to search for all
        names and versions for a particular sequence and shot, we can do::

            >>> tk.abstract_paths_from_template(maya_work, {"Sequence": "AAA", "Shot": "001"})
            /studio/my_proj/sequences/AAA/001/images/%V/render_1.%04d.exr
            /studio/my_proj/sequences/AAA/001/images/%V/render_2.%04d.exr
            /studio/my_proj/sequences/AAA/001/images/%V/render_3.%04d.exr

        .. note:: There are situations where the resulting abstract paths may not match any files on disk

        Take the following template::

            render: sequences/{Sequence}/{Shot}/images/{Shot}.{SEQ}.jpg

        Assuming ``Shot`` is provided via the ``fields`` argument, the method will avoid
        listing all files in the leaf directory since ``{SEQ}`` is abstract and ``{Shot}``
        is known. The following abstract path will be returned even if only the
        parent ``images`` directory exists::

            /studio/my_proj/sequences/AAA/001/images/001.%04d.exr
