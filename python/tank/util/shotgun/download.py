    """
    Convenience method that downloads a file from a given url.
    This method will take into account any proxy settings which have
    been defined in the Shotgun connection parameters.

    In some cases, the target content of the url is not known beforehand.
    For example, the url ``https://my-site.shotgunstudio.com/thumbnail/full/Asset/1227``
    may redirect into ``https://some-site/path/to/a/thumbnail.png``. In
    such cases, you can set the optional use_url_extension parameter to True - this
    will cause the method to append the file extension of the resolved url to
    the filename passed in via the location parameter. So for the urls given
    above, you would get the following results:

    - location="/path/to/file" and use_url_extension=False would return "/path/to/file"
    - location="/path/to/file" and use_url_extension=True would return "/path/to/file.png"

    :param url: url to download

                                   contents. The newly constructed full path name
                                   will be returned.

    :returns: Full filepath to the downloaded file. This may have been altered from
              the input ``location`` if ``use_url_extension`` is True and a file extension
              could be determined from the resolved url.
