    Finds publishes in Shotgun given paths on disk.
    This method is similar to the find method in the Shotgun API,
    except that instead of an Entity type, a list of files is
    passed into the function.

    In addition to a list of files, shotgun filters can also be specified.
    This may be useful if for example all publishes with a certain status
    should be retrieved.

    By default, the shotgun id is returned for each successfully identified path.
    If you want to retrieve additional fields, you can specify these using
    the fields parameter.

    The method will return a dictionary, keyed by path. The value will be
    a standard shotgun query result dictionary, for example::

        {
            "/foo/bar" : { "id": 234, "type": "TankPublishedFile", "code": "some data" },
            "/foo/baz" : { "id": 23,  "type": "TankPublishedFile", "code": "some more data" }
        }

    are not returned in the dictionary.
