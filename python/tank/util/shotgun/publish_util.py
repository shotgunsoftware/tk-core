def find_publish(

    """
    Finds publishes in Shotgun given paths on disk.
    This method is similar to the find method in the Shotgun API,
    except that instead of an Entity type, a list of files is
    passed into the function.

    In addition to a list of files, shotgun filters can also be specified.
    This may be useful if for example all publishes with a certain status
    should be retrieved.

    By default, the shotgun id is returned for each successfully identified path.
    If you want to retrieve additional fields, you can specify these using
    the fields parameter.

    By default, only publishes in the current project will be found. If you
    want to retreive publishes from any active project in the pipeline config,
    you can specify the only_current_project param to False.

    The method will return a dictionary, keyed by path. The value will be
    a standard shotgun query result dictionary, for example::

        {
            "/foo/bar" : { "id": 234, "type": "TankPublishedFile", "code": "some data" },
            "/foo/baz" : { "id": 23,  "type": "TankPublishedFile", "code": "some more data" }
        }

    Fields that are not found, or filtered out by the filters parameter,
    are not returned in the dictionary.

    :param tk: :class:`~sgtk.Sgtk` instance
    :param list_of_paths: List of full paths for which information should be retrieved
    :param filters: Optional list of shotgun filters to apply.
    :param fields: Optional list of fields from the matched entities to
                   return. Defaults to id and type.
    :param only_current_project: Optional boolean to find publishes in Shotgun only from the
                                 current project (True) or from any active project (False).
