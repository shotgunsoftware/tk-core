def resolve_publish_path(tk, sg_publish_data):
    """
    Returns a local path on disk given a dictionary of Shotgun publish data.

    This acts as the inverse of :meth:`register_publish` and
    resolves a local path on disk given some Shotgun publish data,
    typically obtained by a Shotgun API ``find()`` call.

    Complex logic is applied in order to turn a publish into a
    valid local path. Several exception types are raised to indicate
    the reason why a path could not be resolved, allowing for workflows
    where the logic can be overridden.

    .. note:: This method is also called by :meth:`sgtk.Hook.get_publish_path`
              which is a common method Toolkit apps use to resolve publishes
              into paths.

    **Published File Path Resolution**

    For more information on the published file path resolution, see our `Admin Guide <https://developer.shotgridsoftware.com/8085533c/?title=ShotGrid+Integrations+Admin+Guide#Configuring%20published%20file%20path%20resolution>`_.

    **Parameters**

    :param tk: :class:`~sgtk.Sgtk` instance
    :param sg_publish_data: Dictionary containing Shotgun publish data.
        Needs to at least contain a code, type, id and a path key.

    :returns: A local path to file or file sequence.

    :raises: :class:`~sgtk.util.PublishPathNotDefinedError` if the path isn't defined.
    :raises: :class:`~sgtk.util.PublishPathNotSupported` if the path cannot be resolved.
