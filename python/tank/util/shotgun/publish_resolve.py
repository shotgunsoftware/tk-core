def resolve_publish_path(tk, sg_publish_data):
    """
    Returns a local path on disk given a dictionary of Shotgun publish data.

    This acts as the inverse of :meth:`register_publish` and
    resolves a local path on disk given some Shotgun publish data,
    typically obtained by a Shotgun API ``find()`` call.

    Complex logic is applied in order to turn a publish into a
    valid local path. Several exception types are raised to indicate
    the reason why a path could not be resolved, allowing for workflows
    where the logic can be overridden.

    .. note:: This method is also called by :meth:`sgtk.Hook.get_publish_path`
              which is a common method Toolkit apps use to resolve publishes
              into paths.

    **Resolution Logic**

    The method will attempt to resolve the publish data into a path
    by applying several recipes:

    - First, the ``resolve_publish`` core hook will be called. This hook
      can be used either in order to override any built-in behavior or
      to implement support for url schemes, uploaded files or other modes
      which the default implementation currently doesn't support. The hook
      returns ``None`` by default, indicating that no resolve overrides
      are present.

    - If no path was resolved by the hook, the method will check if the
      publish is associated with a local file link and if so attempt to
      resolve this to a path (for more details see below).

    - Next, it will check if the publish is linked to a ``file://`` url
      and attempt to resolve this.

    - Lastly, if the publish still cannot be resolved, a
      :class:`~sgtk.util.PublishPathNotSupported` is raised.

    **Resolving local file links**

    If the publish is a local file link, its local OS representation
    will be used. Local file links are generated automatically by
    :meth:`register_publish` if the path you are publishing matches
    any local file storage defined in the Shotgun Site Preferences.
    Read more about local file links `here <https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/219030938-Linking-to-local-files>`_.

    Local file storage mappings in Shotgun are global and affect
    all machines, all users and all projects. Sometimes there are cases
    when you want to override these globals to behave differently on a
    specific machine or for a user. This can be done by defining an environment
    variable named of the form ``SHOTGUN_PATH_OS_STORAGENAME``. For example, if
    you are running Windows, your ``PRIMARY`` storage has been set up in
    Shotgun to be ``F:\`` and you want paths on your machine to resolve to ``G:\``
    instead, set an environment variable ``SHOTGUN_PATH_WINDOWS_PRIMARY=G:\``.
    The corresponding variables on Linux and Mac would be ``SHOTGUN_PATH_LINUX_PRIMARY``
    and ``SHOTGUN_PATH_MAC_PRIMARY``.

    .. note:: If no storage has been defined for the current operating system,
              a :class:`~sgtk.util.PublishPathNotDefinedError` is raised.

    **Resolving file urls**

    The method also supports the resolution of ``file://`` urls. Such urls
    are not multi platform and the local storages and environment variables
    will therefore be used to try to resolve such paths in case of ambiguity.

    - First, local storage settings will be downloaded from Shotgun and added to
      a path translation table.

    - Next, similar to the local file linking above, any environment variables
      of the form ``SHOTGUN_PATH_WINDOWS|MAC|LINUX`` or ``SHOTGUN_PATH_WINDOWS|MAC|LINUX_STORAGENAME``
      will be added to the translation table.

    - The ``file://`` path will be compared against all the existing roots
      for all operating systems. The first match detected will be used to translate
      the path into the current operating system platform.

    - If no root matches, the file path will be returned as is.

    For example, you have published the file ``/projects/some/file.txt`` on Linux
    and generated a publish with the url ``file:///projects/some/file.txt``. You have
    either a local storage or environment variable set up with the following paths:

    - Linux Path: ``/projects``
    - Windows Path: ``Q:\projects``
    - Mac Path: ``/projects``

    When running on Windows, the ``file://`` url will therefore be translated to
    ``Q:\\projects\\some\\file.txt``.

    .. note:: If no value has been defined for the current operating system,
              a :class:`~sgtk.util.PublishPathNotDefinedError` is raised.

    **Customization examples**

    If you want to add support beyond local file links and ``file://`` urls, you can
    customize the ``resolve_publish.py`` core hook. This can for example be used to
    add support for the following customizations:

    - Publishes with associated uploaded files could be automatically downloaded
      into an appropriate cache location by the core hook and the path would be
      be returned.

    - Custom url schemes (such as ``perforce://``) could be resolved into local paths.


    **Parameters**

    :param tk: :class:`~sgtk.Sgtk` instance
    :param sg_publish_data: Dictionary containing Shotgun publish data.
        Needs to at least contain a code, type, id and a path key.

    :raises: :class:`~sgtk.util.PublishPathNotDefinedError` if the path isn't defined.
