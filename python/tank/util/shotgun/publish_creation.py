    Creates a Published File in Shotgun.

    **Introduction**

    The publish will be associated with the current context and point
    at the given file. The method will attempt to add the publish to
    Shotgun as a local file link, and failing that it will generate
    a ``file://`` url to represent the path.

    In addition to the path, a version number and a name needs to be provided.
    The version number should reflect the iteration or revision of the publish
    and will be used to populate the number field of the publish that is created
    in Shotgun. The name should represent the name of the item, without any version
    number. This is used to group together publishes in Shotgun and various
    integrations.

    If the path matches any local storage roots defined by the toolkit project,
    it will be uploaded as a local file link to Shotgun. If not matching roots
    are found, the method will retrieve the list of local storages from Shotgun
    and try to locate a suitable storage. Failing that, it will fall back on a
    register the path as a ``file://`` url. For more information on
    this resolution logic, see our
    `Admin Guide <https://support.shotgunsoftware.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000067493#Configuring%20published%20file%20path%20resolution>`_.

    .. note:: Shotgun follows a convention where the name passed to the register publish method is used
              to control how things are grouped together. When Shotgun and Toolkit groups things together,
              things are typically grouped first by project/entity/task and then by publish name and version.

              If you create three publishes in Shotgun, all having the name 'foreground.ma' and version numbers
              1, 2 and 3, Shotgun will assume that these are three revisions of the same content and will
              group them together in a group called 'foreground.ma'.

              We recommend a convention where the ``name`` parameter reflects the filename passed in via
              the ``file_path`` parameter, but with the version number removed. For example:

              - ``file_path: /tmp/layout.v027.ma, name: layout.ma, version_number: 27``
              - ``file_path: /tmp/foreground_v002.%04d.exr, name: foreground.exr, version_number: 2``

    .. note:: When publishing file sequences, the method will try to normalize your path based on the
              current template configuration. For example, if you supply the path ``render.$F4.dpx``,
              it will translated to ``render.%04d.dpx`` automatically, assuming there is a matching
              template defined. If you are not using templates or publishing files that do not match
              any configured templates, always provide sequences on a ``%0xd`` or
              ``%xd`` `printf <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printf_format_string>`_ style
              pattern.

    **Examples**

    The example below shows a basic publish. In addition to the required parameters, it is
    recommended to supply at least a comment and a Publish Type::

        >>> file_path = '/studio/demo_project/sequences/Sequence-1/shot_010/Anm/publish/layout.v001.ma'
        >>> name = 'layout.ma'
        >>> version_number = 1
        >>>
        >>> sgtk.util.register_publish(
            tk,
            context,
            file_path,
            name,
            version_number,
            comment = 'Initial layout composition.',
            published_file_type = 'Maya Scene'
        )

        {'code': 'layout.v001.ma',
         'created_by': {'id': 40, 'name': 'John Smith', 'type': 'HumanUser'},
         'description': 'Initial layout composition.',
         'entity': {'id': 2, 'name': 'shot_010', 'type': 'Shot'},
         'id': 2,
         'published_file_type': {'id': 134, 'type': 'PublishedFileType'},
         'name': 'layout.ma',
         'path': {'content_type': None,
          'link_type': 'local',
          'local_path': '/studio/demo_project/sequences/Sequence-1/shot_010/Anm/publish/layout.v001.ma',
          'local_path_linux': '/studio/demo_project/sequences/Sequence-1/shot_010/Anm/publish/layout.v001.ma',
          'local_path_mac': '/studio/demo_project/sequences/Sequence-1/shot_010/Anm/publish/layout.v001.ma',
          'local_path_windows': 'c:\\studio\\demo_project\\sequences\\Sequence-1\\shot_010\\Anm\\publish\\layout.v001.ma',
          'local_storage': {'id': 1, 'name': 'primary', 'type': 'LocalStorage'},
          'name': 'layout.v001.ma',
          'url': 'file:///studio/demo_project/sequences/Sequence-1/shot_010/Anm/publish/layout.v001.ma'},
         'path_cache': 'demo_project/sequences/Sequence-1/shot_010/Anm/publish/layout.v001.ma',
         'project': {'id': 4, 'name': 'Demo Project', 'type': 'Project'},
         'published_file_type': {'id': 12, 'name': 'Layout Scene', 'type': 'PublishedFileType'},
         'task': None,
         'type': 'PublishedFile',
         'version_number': 1}

    When using the ``dry_run`` option, the returned data will look something like this::

        >>> file_path = '/studio/demo_project/sequences/Sequence-1/shot_010/Anm/publish/layout.v001.ma'
        >>> name = 'layout'
        >>> version_number = 1
        >>>
        >>> sgtk.util.register_publish(
            tk,
            context,
            file_path,
            name,
            version_number,
            comment='Initial layout composition.',
            published_file_type='Layout Scene'
            dry_run=True
        )

        {'code': 'layout.v001.ma',
         'description': 'Initial layout composition.',
         'entity': {'id': 2, 'name': 'shot_010', 'type': 'Shot'},
         'path': {'local_path': '/studio/demo_project/sequences/Sequence-1/shot_010/Anm/publish/layout.v001.ma'},
         'project': {'id': 4, 'name': 'Demo Project', 'type': 'Project'},
         'task': None,
         'type': 'PublishedFile',
         'version_number': 1}

    Be aware that the data may be different if the ``before_register_publish``
    hook has been overridden.

    **Parameters**

    :param tk: :class:`~sgtk.Sgtk` instance
    :param context: A :class:`~sgtk.Context` to associate with the publish. This will
                    populate the ``task`` and ``entity`` link in Shotgun.
    :param path: The path to the file or sequence we want to publish. If the
                 path is a sequence path it will be abstracted so that
                 any sequence keys are replaced with their default values.
    :param name: A name, without version number, which helps distinguish
               this publish from other publishes. This is typically
               used for grouping inside of Shotgun so that all the
               versions of the same "file" can be grouped into a cluster.
               For example, for a Maya publish, where we track only
               the scene name, the name would simply be that: the scene
               name. For something like a render, it could be the scene
               name, the name of the AOV and the name of the render layer.
    :param version_number: The version number of the item we are publishing.


    In addition to the above, the following optional arguments exist:

        - ``task`` - A shotgun entity dictionary with keys ``id`` and ``type`` (where type should always be ``Task``).
          This value will be used to populate the task field for the created Shotgun publish record.
          If no value is specified, the task will be determined based on the context parameter.

        - ``comment`` - A string containing a description of what is being published.

        - ``thumbnail_path`` - A path to a thumbnail (png or jpeg) which will be uploaded to shotgun
          and associated with the publish.

        - ``dependency_paths`` - A list of file system paths that should be attempted to be registered
          as dependencies. Files in this listing that do not appear as publishes in shotgun will be ignored.

        - ``dependency_ids`` - A list of publish ids which should be registered as dependencies.

        - ``published_file_type`` - A publish type in the form of a string. If the publish type does not
          already exist in Shotgun, it will be created.

        - ``update_entity_thumbnail`` - Push thumbnail up to the associated entity

        - ``update_task_thumbnail`` - Push thumbnail up to the associated task

        - ``created_by`` - Override for the user that will be marked as creating the publish.  This should
          be in the form of shotgun entity, e.g. {"type":"HumanUser", "id":7}. If not set, the user will
          be determined using :meth:`sgtk.util.get_current_user`.

        - ``created_at`` - Override for the date the publish is created at.  This should be a python
          datetime object

        - ``version_entity`` - The Shotgun review version that the publish should be linked to. This
          should be a dictionary of keys ``id`` and ``type`` (where type should always be ``Version``).
          This parameter is useful for workflows where a Shotgun Version has already been created for review
          purposes and you want to associate the publish created by this method.

          Note: For workflows where you have an existing review version and want to create a series of associated
          publishes, you may want to extract a :class:`~sgtk.Context` from the Version entity and pass that
          to the :meth:`register_publish` method in order to ensure consistency in how objects are associated
          in Shotgun.

        - ``sg_fields`` - Some additional Shotgun fields as a dict (e.g. ``{'sg_custom_field': 'hello'}``)

        - ``dry_run`` - Boolean. If set, do not actually create a database entry. Return the
          dictionary of data that would be supplied to Shotgun to create the PublishedFile entity.

    :raises: :class:`ShotgunPublishError` on failure.
    :returns: The created entity dictionary.
