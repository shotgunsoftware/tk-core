class LocalFileStorageManager(object):
    """
    Class that encapsulates logic for resolving local storage paths.

    Toolkit needs to store cache data, logs and other items at runtime.
    Some of this data is global, other is per site or per configuration.

    This class provides a consistent and centralized interface for resolving
    such paths and also handles compatibility across generations of path
    standards if and when these change between releases.

    .. note:: All paths returned by this class are local to the currently running
              user and typically private or with limited access settings for other users.

              If the current user's home directory is not an appropriate location to store
              your user files, you can use the ``SHOTGUN_HOME`` environment variable to
              override the root location of the files. In that case, the location for the
              user files on each platform will be:

              - Logging:     ``$SHOTGUN_HOME/logs``
              - Cache:       ``$SHOTGUN_HOME``
              - Persistent:  ``$SHOTGUN_HOME/data``
              - Preferences: ``$SHOTGUN_HOME/preferences``


    :constant CORE_V17: Indicates compatibility with Core 0.17 or earlier
    :constant CORE_V18: Indicates compatibility with Core 0.18 or later

    :constant LOGGING:     Indicates a path suitable for storing logs, useful for debugging
    :constant CACHE:       Indicates a path suitable for storing cache data that can be deleted
                           without any loss of functionality or state.
    :constant PERSISTENT:  Indicates a path suitable for storing data that needs
                           to be retained between sessions.
    :constant PREFERENCES: Indicates a path that suitable for storing settings files and preferences.
