        Retrieves the operating system http proxy.

        First, the method scans the environment for variables named http_proxy, in case insensitive way.
        If both lowercase and uppercase environment variables exist (and disagree), lowercase is preferred.

        When the method cannot find such environment variables:
        - for Mac OS X, it will look for proxy information from Mac OS X System Configuration,
        - for Windows, it will look for proxy information from Windows Systems Registry.

        .. note:: There is a restriction when looking for proxy information from
                  Mac OS X System Configuration or Windows Systems Registry:
                  in these cases, the Toolkit does not support the use of proxies
                  which require authentication (username and password).
