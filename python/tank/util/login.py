    Retrieves the current user as a dictionary of metadata values. Note: This method connects to

    If a user has been authenticated via a login prompt, this method will return the credentials
    associated with that user. If Toolkit has been configured to use a script user to connect to
    Shotgun, a core hook will be executed to established which user is associated with the current
