    This version however doesn't allow to override stderr, stdout and stdin. stdin
    is always closed right after launch and stderr is always redirected to stdout. This
    is done in order to avoid DUPLICATE_SAME_ACCESS errors on Windows. Learn more about
    it here: https://bugs.python.org/issue3905.

    :returns: The output from the command
    :raises: If the return code was non-zero it raises a SubprocessCalledProcessError.
             The SubprocessCalledProcessError object will have the return code in the returncode
             attribute and any output in the output attribute.
