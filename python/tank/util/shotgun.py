                    populate the task and entity link in Shotgun.
    :param path: The path to the file or sequence we want to publish. If the
                 path is a sequence path it will be abstracted so that
                 any sequence keys are replaced with their default values.
    :param name: A name, without version number, which helps distinguish
               this publish from other publishes. This is typically
               used for grouping inside of Shotgun so that all the
               versions of the same "file" can be grouped into a cluster.
               For example, for a maya publish, where we track only
               the scene name, the name would simply be that: the scene
               name. For something like a render, it could be the scene
               name, the name of the AOV and the name of the render layer.
    :param version_number: The version number of the item we are publishing.


    In addition to the above, the following optional arguments exist:

        - ``task`` - A shotgun entity dictionary with id and type (which should always be Task).
          if no value is specified, the task will be grabbed from the context object.

        - ``comment`` - A string containing a description of the comment

        - ``thumbnail_path`` - A path to a thumbnail (png or jpeg) which will be uploaded to shotgun
          and associated with the publish.

        - ``dependency_paths`` - A list of file system paths that should be attempted to be registered
          as dependencies. Files in this listing that do not appear as publishes in shotgun will be ignored.

        - ``dependency_ids`` - A list of publish ids which should be registered as dependencies.

        - ``published_file_type`` - A tank type in the form of a string which should match a tank type
          that is registered in Shotgun.

        - ``update_entity_thumbnail`` - Push thumbnail up to the attached entity

        - ``update_task_thumbnail`` - Push thumbnail up to the attached task

        - ``created_by`` - Override for the user that will be marked as creating the publish.  This should
          be in the form of shotgun entity, e.g. {"type":"HumanUser", "id":7}

        - ``created_at`` - Override for the date the publish is created at.  This should be a python
          datetime object
                    
        - ``version_entity`` - The Shotgun version entity this published file should be linked to

        - ``sg_fields`` - Some additional Shotgun fields as a dict (e.g. ``{'tag_list': ['foo', 'bar']}``)
