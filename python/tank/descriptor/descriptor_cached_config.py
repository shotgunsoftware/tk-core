    Descriptor that describes a cache Toolkit Configuration. Cached configurations are managed
    by the ToolkitManager when bootstrapping and therefore are not meant to be updated manually
    like installed configurations are.

    These configurations live inside a bundle cache and have a core associated with them. They do
    not share a core like an installed configuration would and therefore they have a set of
    interpreter files that live alongside the configuration, even tough technically these files
    are part of the core's configuration.

        For example, a descriptor-based configuration using ``tk-config-basic``
        ``v1.2.0`` would find the configuration at
        ``%SHOTGUN_HOME%\bundle_cache\app_store\tk-config-basic\v1.2.0``.
