class IODescriptorDownloadable(IODescriptorBase):
    """
    Base class for descriptors that can be downloaded locally to a path on disk.

    In order to create a Descriptor associated with data that can
    be downloaded locally to disk, it is necessary to derive from this class.
    By default, the AppStore, Git and Shotgun entity descriptors can be downloaded
    to disk and hence are of type :class: `IODescriptorDownloadable`.

    Descriptor data can be downloaded by invoking the :meth: `download_local` on instances
    of such derived classes. These classes are also expected to implement the
    :meth: `_download_local` and optionally, the :meth: `_post_download`.

    A general implementation of such a Descriptor class will be of the form:

    eg. class MyNewDownloadableDescriptor(IODescriptorDownloadable):
            def _download_local(self, destination_path):
                # .. code to download data to destination_path

            def _post_download(self, download_path):
                # .. code that will be executed post download.
    """

    _DOWNLOAD_TRANSACTION_COMPLETE_FILE = "install_complete"

    def download_local(self):
        """

        cache path.

        It does so in a two step process. First, by downloading it to
        a temporary bundle cache path (typically in a 'tmp/<uuid>' directory
        in the bundle cache path), then, by moving the data to the primary bundle
        cache path for that descriptor. This helps to guard against multiple
        processes attempting to download the same descriptor simultaneously.
