    Factory method. Use this method to construct all DescriptorIO instances.

    A descriptor is immutable in the sense that it always points at the same code -
    this may be a particular frozen version out of that toolkit app store that
    will not change or it may be a dev area where the code can change. Given this,
    descriptors are cached and only constructed once for a given descriptor URL.

    :param sg: Shotgun connection to associated site
    :param descriptor_type: Either AppDescriptor.APP, CORE, ENGINE or FRAMEWORK
    :param dict_or_uri: A std descriptor dictionary dictionary or string
    :param bundle_cache_root: Root path to where downloaded apps are cached
    :param fallback_roots: List of immutable fallback cache locations where
                           apps will be searched for. Note that when descriptors
                           download new content, it always ends up in the
                           bundle_cache_root.
    :param resolve_latest: If true, the latest version will be determined and returned.

                           If set to True, no version information needs to be supplied with
                           the descriptor dictionary/uri for descriptor types which support
                           a version number concept. Please note that setting this flag
                           to true will typically affect performance - an external connection
                           is often required in order to establish what the latest version is.

                           If a remote connection cannot be established when attempting to determine
                           the latest version, a local scan will be carried out and the highest
                           version number that is cached locally will be returned.
    :param constraint_pattern: If resolve_latest is True, this pattern can be used to constrain
                           the search for latest to only take part over a subset of versions.
                           This is a string that can be on the following form:
                                - v0.1.2, v0.12.3.2, v0.1.3beta - a specific version
                                - v0.12.x - get the highest v0.12 version
                                - v1.x.x - get the highest v1 version
    :param local_fallback_when_disconnected: If resolve_latest is set to True, specify the behaviour
                            in the case when no connection to a remote descriptor can be established,
                            for example because and internet connection isn't available. If True, the
                            descriptor factory will attempt to fall back on any existing locally cached
                            bundles and return the latest one available. If False, a
                            :class:`TankDescriptorError` is raised instead.

    If the given descriptor dictionary or uri is one of the
