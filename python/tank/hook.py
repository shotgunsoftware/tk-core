class Hook(object):
    """
    Hooks are implemented in a python file and they all derive from a :class:`Hook` base class.

    If you are writing an app that loads files into Maya, Nuke or other DCCs, a hook is a good
    way to expose the actual loading logic, so that not only can be customized by a user, but
    so that you could even add support for a new DCC to your load app without having to update it.

    First, you would create a ``hooks/actions.py`` file in your app. This would contain a hook class::

        import sgtk
        HookBaseClass = sgtk.get_hook_baseclass()

        class Actions(HookBaseClass):

            def list_actions(self, sg_publish_data):
                '''
                Given some Shotgun publish data, return a list of
                actions that can be performed

                :param sg_publish_data: Dictionary of publish data from Shotgun
                :returns: List of action strings
                '''
                # The base implementation implements an action to show
                # the item in Shotgun
                return ["show_in_sg"]

            def run_action(self, action, sg_publish_data):
                '''
                Execute the given action

                :param action: name of action. One of the items returned by list_actions.
                :param sg_publish_data: Dictionary of publish data from Shotgun
                '''
                if action == "show_in_sg":

                    url = "%s/detail/%s/%d" % (
                        self.parent.shotgun.base_url,
                        sg_publish_data["type"],
                        sg_publish_data["id"]
                        )
                    QtGui.QDesktopServices.openUrl(QtCore.QUrl(url))

    The above code forms a generic base for your hook with a basic implementation that works
    everywhere.

    In the app manifest (``info.yml``), where we define all the basic configuration properties for the app,
    we define an actions hook::

        configuration:

            actions_hook:
                type: hook
                default_value: "{self}/actions.py"
                description: Hook which contains all methods for action management.

    From the app code itself, you can now use :meth:`~sgtk.platform.Application.execute_hook_method()`
    to call out to the hook::

        # when creating a list of items in the UI for your app -
        # given a shotgun publish, build a menu of avaialable actions:
        actions = self.execute_hook_method("actions_hook", "list_actions", sg_data)

        # in a callback method once a user has selected an action -
        # call out to the hook to execute the action
        self.execute_hook_method("actions_hook", "run_action", sg_data, action_name)

    In the configuration for your app, you can now 'glue together' different functionality
    for different scenarios. For example, when you install the app to run inside the Maya
    engine, you want to be able to import maya files into maya. We implement this by adding a
    custom publish hook for maya. This can either be placed with the app itself, in the ``hooks``
    folder in the configuration, or in the maya engine. In this case, we'll add a ``hooks/actions.py``
    to the maya engine. This file looks like this::

        import sgtk
        HookBaseClass = sgtk.get_hook_baseclass()

        class MayaActions(HookBaseClass):

            def list_actions(self, sg_publish_data):
                '''
                Given some Shotgun publish data, return a list of
                actions that can be performed

                :param sg_publish_data: Dictionary of publish data from Shotgun
                :returns: List of action strings
                '''
                # first get base class actions
                actions = HookBaseClass.list_actions(sg_publish_data)

                # Add maya actions
                if sg_publish_data["published_file_type"]["name"] == "Maya Scene":
                    actions += ["reference", "import"]

            def run_action(self, action, sg_publish_data):
                '''
                Execute the given action

                :param action: name of action. One of the items returned by list_actions.
                :param sg_publish_data: Dictionary of publish data from Shotgun
                '''
                if action == "reference":
                    # do maya reference operation

                elif action == "import":
                    # do maya import operation

                else:
                    # pass on to base class
                    return HookBaseClass.run_action(action, sg_publish_data)

    The above hook implements a couple of actions that are designed to work in Maya.
    Lastly, we need to tell the app to pick up this file. In the environment configuration for the app
    running inside of maya, we point it at our engine specific hook::

        tk-maya:
            tk-multi-myapp:
                actions_hook: '{engine}/actions.py'

    When we are running the app configuration in maya, the actions hook will automatically
    resolve the hook code distributed with the maya engine. The base class will be automatically
    determined to be the default value set in the manifest, allowing for the app to carry a default
    base implementation that is always taken into account.

    .. _hook-formats:

    **Resolving paths to hooks**

    Several different path formats exist, making this a very powerful configuration mechanism:

    - ``{self}/path/to/foo.py`` -- looks in the ``hooks`` folder in the local app, engine of framework.

    - ``{self}/{engine_name}_publish.py`` -- If running in maya, looks for a ``tk-maya_publish.py`` in
      the ``hooks`` folder in the local app, engine of framework. If running in Nuke, it would instead
      look for ``BUNDLE_ROOT/hooks/tk-nuke_publish.py``.

    - ``{config}/path/to/foo.py`` -- Looks in the ``hooks`` folder in the configuration.

    - ``{$HOOK_PATH}/path/to/foo.py``  -- expression based around an environment variable.

    - ``{engine}/path/to/foo.py`` -- looks in the ``hooks`` folder of the current engine.

    - ``{tk-framework-perforce_v1.x.x}/path/to/foo.py`` -- looks in the ``hooks`` folder of a
      framework instance that exists in the current environment. Basically, each entry inside the
      frameworks section in the current environment can be specified here - all these entries are
      on the form frameworkname_versionpattern, for example ``tk-framework-widget_v0.1.2`` or
      ``tk-framework-shotgunutils_v1.3.x``.

    Supported legacy formats:

    - ``foo`` -- Equivalent to ``{config}/foo.py``

    You can also provide your own inheritance chains. For example, if you wanted to add your own,
    project specific maya hooks to this app, you could do this by creating a hook file, placing
    it in your configuration's ``hooks`` folder and then configure it like this::

        tk-maya:
            tk-multi-myapp:
                actions_hook: '{engine}/actions.py:{config}/maya_actions.py'

    This would execute your ``maya_actions.py`` hook and make sure that that hook inherits from the
    engine specific hook, making sure that you get both your custom actions, the engine default actions
    and the app's built-in actions.
