    Executes a hook, old-school style.

    New style hook execution, with method arguments and support for inheritance.
    
    This method takes a list of hook paths and will load each of the classes
    in, while maintaining the correct state of the class returned via 
    get_hook_baseclass(). Once all classes have been successfully loaded, 
    the last class in the list is instantiated and the specified method
    is executed.
    
        Example: ["/tmp/a.py", "/tmp/b.py", "/tmp/c.py"]
        
        1. The code in a.py is loaded in. get_hook_baseclass() will return Hook
           at this point. class HookA is returned from our plugin loader.
        
        2. /tmp/b.py is loaded in. get_hook_baseclass() now returns HookA, so 
           if the hook code in B utilises get_hook_baseclass, this will will
           set up an inheritance relationship with A
        
        3. /tmp/c.py is finally loaded in, get_hook_baseclass() now returns HookB.
        
        4. HookC class is instantiated and method method_name is executed.
    
    :param hook_paths: List of full paths to hooks, in inheritance order.
    :param parent: Parent object. This will be accessible inside
                   the hook as self.parent, and is typically an 
                   app, engine or core object.
