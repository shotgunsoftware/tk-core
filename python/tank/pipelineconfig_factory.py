    Edge case notes:

    Normally, this command returns all the pipeline configurations that

    However, there are edge cases where it may return pipeline configurations
    for *multiple* projects.

    in the case there are overlapping storage roots, or where a project is named
    the same name as a storage root, this may lead to a scenario where a path on
    disk could potentially belong to *two* projects. In this case, this method will
    return the pipeline configurations for both projects.

    For example, imagine the following setup:

    Storages: f:\ and f:\foo
    Project names: foo and bar

    (Note that the project name 'foo' is named the same as the storage F:\foo)

    This means we have the following project roots:
    (1) f:\foo      (storage f:\, project foo)
    (2) f:\bar      (storage f:\, project bar)
    (3) f:\foo\foo  (storage f:\foo, project foo)
    (4) f:\foo\bar  (storage f:\foo, project bar)
