# Establish pipeline configuration context if needed
# 
# When the tank command executes, or when the python API is imported
# via the API proxy that is available with every non-localized pipeline config,
# an environment variable TANK_CURRENT_PC, is set, pointing at the configuration
# associated with the currently running config. This is to ensure that the right 
# version of the code is associated with the currently running project 
# configuration. 
#
# However, in the case when a cloned configuration has been localized,
# the API proxy has been replaced by the actual core API code.
# In this case, we will set the TANK_CURRENT_PC explicitly.
#
# The logic below is fundamentally to avoid the issue that when a cloned localized
# configuration has its python sgtk/tank module imported directly, it will associate
# itself with the primary config rather than with the config where the code is located. 

import os
from .platform import constants

if "TANK_CURRENT_PC" not in os.environ:
    # find the pipeline configuration root, probe for a key file
    # (templates.yml) and use this test to determine if this code is 
    # a core API located inside a pipeline configuration.
    #
    # NOTE! This is a very particular piece of logic, which is also 
    # duplicated inside the tank command and the python proxy wrappers.
    # it is intentionally left here in the init method to highlight that  
    # is unique and special.
