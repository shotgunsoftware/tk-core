        Retrieves the pipeline configurations available for a given project.

        In order for a pipeline configuration to be considered as available, the following
        conditions must be met:

           - There can only be one primary
           - If there is one site level and one project level primary, the site level
             primary is not available.
           - If there are multiple site level or multiple project level primaries,
             only the one with the lowest id is available, unless one or more of them is a Toolkit
             Classic Primary, in which case the Toolkit Classic Primary with the lowest id will
             be returned.
           - A :class:`~sgtk.descriptor.Descriptor` object must be able to be created from the
             pipeline configuration.
           - All sandboxes are available.

        In practice, this means that if there are 3 primaries, two of them using plugin ids and
        one of them not using them, the one not using a plugin id will always be used.

        This filtering also takes into account the current user and optional pipeline
        configuration name or id. If the :meth:`pipeline_configuration` property has been
        set to a string, it will look for pipeline configurations with that specific name.
        If it has been set to ``None``, any pipeline that can be applied for the current
        user and project will be retrieved. Note that this method does not support
        :meth:`pipeline_configuration` being an integer.

        **Return value**

        The data structure returned is a dictionary with several keys to
        describe the configuration, for example::

            {'descriptor': <CachedConfigDescriptor <IODescriptorAppStore sgtk:descriptor:app_store?name=tk-config-basic&version=v1.1.6>>,
             'descriptor_source_uri': 'sgtk:descriptor:app_store?name=tk-config-basic',
             'id': 500,
             'name': 'Primary',
             'project': {'id': 123, 'name': 'Test Project', 'type': 'Project'},
             'type': 'PipelineConfiguration'}

        The returned dictionary mimics the result of a Shotgun API query, including
        standard fields for ``type``, ``id``, ``name`` and ``project``. In addition,
        the resolved descriptor object is returned in a ``descriptor`` key.

        For pipeline configurations which are defined in Shotgun via their **descriptor** field,
        this field is returned in a ``descriptor_source_uri`` key. For pipeline configurations
        defined via an uploaded attachment or explicit path fields, the ``descriptor_source_uri``
        key will return ``None``.

        .. note:: Note as per the example above how the ``descriptor_source_uri``
                  value can be different than the uri of the resolved descriptor;
                  this happens in the case when a descriptor uri is omitting
                  the version number and tracking against the latest version
                  number available.
                  In that case, the ``descriptor`` key will contain the
                  fully resolved descriptor object, representing the
                  latest descriptor version as of right now, where as the
                  ``descriptor_source_uri`` key contains the versionless descriptor
                  uri string as it is defined in Shotgun.

        :param project: Project entity link to enumerate pipeline configurations for.
            If ``None``, this will enumerate the pipeline configurations
            for the site configuration.

        :returns: List of pipeline configurations.
        :rtype: List of dictionaries with syntax described above.

            ``name`` field (case insensitive), then the ``project`` field and finally then ``id`` field.
