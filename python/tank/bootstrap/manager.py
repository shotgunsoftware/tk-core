        The entry point defines the scope of the bootstrap operation.

        If you are bootstrapping into an entire Toolkit pipeline, e.g
        a traditional Toolkit setup, this should be left blank.

        If you are writing a plugin that is intended to run side by
        side with other plugins in your target environment, the entry
        point will be used to define a scope and sandbox in which your
        plugin will execute.

        In the future, it will be possible to use the entry point value
        to customize the behavior of a
        plugin via Shotgun. At bootstrap, toolkit will look for a pipeline
        configuration with a matching name and entry point. If found, this
        will be used instead of the one defined by the :meth:`base_configuration`
        property.

        It is possible for multiple plugins running in different DCCs
        to share the same entry point - in this case, they would all
        get their settings and setup from a shared configuration. If you
        were to override the base configuration in Shotgun, your override
        would affect the entire suite of plugins. This kind of setup allows
        for the development of several plugins in different DCCs that together
        form a curated workflow.

        We recommend an entry point naming convention of ``provider_service``,
        for example:

        - A plugin maintained by the RV group which handles review inside RV would
          be named ``rv_review``.
        - A plugin for a toolkit load/publish workflow that runs inside of Maya and
          Nuke, maintained by the Toolkit team, could be named ``sgtk_publish``.
        - A plugin containg a studio VR workflow across multiple DCCs could be
          named ``studioname_vrtools``.

        Please make sure that your entry point is **unique, explicit and short**.

                      be used, set :meth:`do_shotgun_config_lookup` to False.
