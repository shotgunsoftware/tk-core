from ..errors import TankError

class Action(object):
    """
    Describes an executable action. Base class that all tank command actions derive from.
    
    The execution payload should be defined in the run_* methods, which will be called
    by the system, either via a tank command or via an API accessor.
    
    The action runs in an operational state controlled by the mode parameter.
    At the point when one of the run_* method are called by the system, certain member 
    variables are guaranteed to have been populated, depending on the *mode*.
    
    Action.GLOBAL
    -------------
    No state is set up. Basically, you don't even have access to a tk interface at this point.
    Commands that run in this state are commands that handle things that happen outside a project.
    Examples are project setup and upgrading the core api.
    
    Action.TK_INSTANCE
    ------------------
    A TK API instance exists. This implicitly means that a pipeline configuration also exists.
    An executing action can access the associated tk instance via the self.tk member variable.
    This is the most common state in which toolkit commands run. Examples include all commands
    which operate on a project (install_app, updates, validation, cloning, etc).
    
    Action.CTX
    ----------
    A TK API instance exists and a context has been established. Your command can access the
    member variables self.tk and self.context. An example of an Action / tank command that 
    uses this mode is the folder creation and folder preview commands.
    
    Action.ENGINE
    -------------
    A TK API instance exists, a context has been established and an engine has been started.
    The engine can be accessed via self.engine. An example of a command running using this level
    is the Action brigde which connects App commands with tank commands; this is how app commands
    are executed when you run the inside the Shell engine.
