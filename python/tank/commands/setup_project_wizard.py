    can be used to build interactive wizard-style project setup processes.

    # this can be an interactive process which includes validation etc.

        Below is a summary of the various return parameters:
        
        localize - If set to True, the localize boolean indicates that the core API will be 'baked in' to the
                   project configuration to form an autonomous (localized) setup which doesn't depend on 
                   any other locations on disk. In this case, the core_path data represents the location from
                   where the core API will be obtained. In this case, the only path in the core_path which 
                   is relevant  will be the one that corresponds to the current operating system.
        
        using_runtime - If set to true, this indicates that the core used for the setup will be picked up
                        from the currently executing core API.
        
        pipeline_config - If the core is picked up from an existing pipeline configuration in Shotgun, this 
                          parameter will hold a dictionary with various shotgun values representing the 
                          pipeline configuration and its associated project. If the core used to create the project
                          is not associated with an existing pipeline configuration, None is returned.
        
        core_path - If localize is set to False, the configuration will share an API and it will be picked up 
                    from the location indicated in the core_path parameter. In this case, a None value for a path
                    indicates that this platform will not be supported and the project will not be able to execute
                    on that platform unless further configuration adjustments are carried out.   
        
        :returns: dictionary, see above for details.
