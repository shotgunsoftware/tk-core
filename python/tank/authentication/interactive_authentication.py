Authentication and session renewal handling.

This module handles asking the user for their password, login etc.
It will try to use a QT UI to prompt the user if possible, but may
fall back on a console (stdin/stdout) based workflow if QT isn't available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE! This module is part of the authentication library internals and should
not be called directly. Interfaces and implementation of this module may change
at any point.
