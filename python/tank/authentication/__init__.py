The Shotgun Authentication module.

This module provides the user with a dialog or console prompts
to retrieve the login and password from a user in order to authenticate. A session is then
created and stored on disk. Whenever a connection to the Shotgun site is required, those
credentials are reused. If a Toolkit-enabled process is launched a second time, the stored
credentials are reused if available.
