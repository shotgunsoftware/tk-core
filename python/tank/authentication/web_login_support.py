"""
Web-based login is required when the target Shotgun site uses SSO or Autodesk
Identity for authentication.

This flag will control if the Unified Login Flow is to be used or not. By
default, it will not be used.

Unfortunately, not all DCCs/Scripts/Applications that use the Toolkit have all
the required dependencies to fully support Web-based authentication and renewal.
This can be a problem for programs not started by the Shotgun Desktop or if
the Shotgun Desktop is closed after. When the program attemps to authenticate
or renew a session against a Shotgun site that uses SSO/Autodesk Identity, it
will fail to do so and will not provide meaningful feedback to the user.

The requirements are:
- Full support for WebKit/WebEngine with access to the cookie store,
- SSL support
- TLS v1.2 support
- NTLM patch

Some of these could be checked at run-time, but others (TLS v1.2 support,
NTLM patch) are more difficult to detect.

Unless this flag is explicitely set to True by the enclosing program, we
will take for granted that the full web login flow is not supported.

WARNING: while SSO login has been supported since tk-core 0.18.151/Shotgun
Desktop 1.5.3, it was possible for a DCC to be unable to authenticate or renew
a session. This flag will not change that behaviour.

At this time, only the Shotgun Desktop and Shotgun Create fully support the
Web based authentication.
