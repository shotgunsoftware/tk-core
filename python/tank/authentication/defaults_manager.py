class DefaultsManager(object):
    """
    The defaults manager allows a client of the Shotgun Authenticator class
    to customize various behaviors around data storage and settings.

    By default, when you construct a :class:`ShotgunAuthenticator` object, it will be
    instantiated with a standard defaults manager implementation. This will
    work for most cases - user session credentials will be stored in a file
    on disk and the system maintains a concept of a current user and a current
    host.

    If a setting isn't found, the DefaultsManager will fall back to the value stored inside
    ``toolkit.ini`` See :ref:`centralizing_settings` for more information.

    If, however, you want to implement a custom behavior around how defaults
    are managed, simply derive from this class and pass your custom instance
    to the :class:`ShotgunAuthenticator` object when you construct it.

    :param str fixed_host: Allows to specify the host that will be used for authentication.
        Defaults to ``None``.

        When doing an interactive login, this indicates if the user can decide
        the host to connect to. In its default implementation, the :class:`DefaultsManager`
        will indicate that the host is not fixed, meaning that the user will be
        presented with an option to pick a site at login time, unless a default
        host was provided during initialization. If that is the case, then this
        method will return ``True``.

        With something like Toolkit, where each project already have a specific
        site association, you typically want to override this to return True,
        indicating to the authenticator not to ask the user which site they want
        to log in to.

        :returns: False if the user should be given an option to decide which host
                  to log in to, True if the host is already predetermined and cannot

        used to implement single sign-on between all Toolkit desktop
        applications (at the moment, tank and Shotgun Desktop).

        The default implementation will return the fixed host if one was provided
        during the initialization. If fixed host was provided, the default
        implementation maintains a concept of a "current host" which will be
        presented as a default to users when they are logging in.

        When the host is fixed, this must return a value and this value will
        be used as an absolute rather than a default suggested to the user.

            Python's `urllib.getproxies <https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html#urllib.getproxies>`_
            to find an HTTP proxy.

            There is a restriction when looking for proxy information from Mac OS X System Configuration or
            Windows Systems Registry: in these cases, Toolkit does not support the use of proxies
            which require authentication (username and password).

        The returned format will be the same as is being used in the Shotgun API.

        The default implementation maintains a concept where it stores the currently
        authenticated user and its session token and tries to return this if possible,
        effectively meaning that the user will be automatically logged in without having
        to be prompted.

        This is typically subclassed if you want to track the notion of a current
        user in an alternative way or maintain a separate notion of the "current" user,
