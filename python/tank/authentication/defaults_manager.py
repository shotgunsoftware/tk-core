class DefaultsManager(object):
    """
    The defaults manager allows a client of the Shotgun Authenticator class
    to customize various behaviors around data storage and settings.

    By default, when you construct a :class:`ShotgunAuthenticator` object, it will be
    instantiated with a standard defaults manager implementation. This will
    work for most cases - user session credentials will be stored in a file
    on disk and the system maintains a concept of a current user and a current
    host.

    If a setting isn't found, the DefaultsManager will fall back to the value stored inside
    ``toolkit.ini`` See :ref:`centralizing_settings` for more information.

    If, however, you want to implement a custom behavior around how defaults
    are managed, simply derive from this class and pass your custom instance
    to the :class:`ShotgunAuthenticator` object when you construct it.

        the host to connect to. In its default implementation, the :class:`DefaultsManager`
        will indicate that the host is not fixed, meaning that the user will be
        presented with an option to pick a site at login time.

        With something like Toolkit, where each project already have a specific
        site association, you typically want to override this to return True,
        indicating to the authenticator not to ask the user which site they want
        to log in to.

        .. note:: If the centralized settings do not specify an HTTP proxy, Toolkit will rely on
            Python's `urllib.getproxies <https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html#urllib.getproxies>`_
            to find an HTTP proxy.

            There is a restriction when looking for proxy information from Mac OS X System Configuration or
            Windows Systems Registry: in these cases, Toolkit does not support the use of proxies
            which require authentication (username and password).

        The returned format will be the same as is being used in the Shotgun API.
        For more information, see the `Shotgun API documentation

        A dictionary with a login and a session token should be returned, which will
        allow the authentication system to authenticate the user.

        The default implementation maintains a concept where it stores the currently
        authenticated user and its session token and tries to return this if possible,
        effectively meaning that the user will be automatically logged in without having
        to be prompted.

        This is typically subclassed if you want to track the notion of a current
        user in an alternative way or maintain a separate notion of the "current" user,
