class ShotgunUser(object):
    """
    Represents a Shotgun user, either a script or a person and provides an entry point
    into the authentication system.

    User objects are created via the :class:`ShotgunAuthenticator` object, which will handle
    caching user objects on disk, prompting the user for their credentials etc.

    Once you have retrieved one of the user objects below, this can be used to access
    Shotgun in a seamless way. The :meth:`create_sg_connection()` will return a Shotgun API handle
    which is associated with the current user. This API handle is also monitored for
    authentication timeouts, so if the user's session times out (typically due to periods
    of inactivity), the user may be prompted (via a QT UI or stdin/stdout if only
    console is accessible) to refresh their Shotgun session by typing in their password.

    If you need to persist the user object, this is possible via the serialization
    methods. This is particularly useful if you need to pass a user object from one
    process to another, for example when launching a DCC such as Maya or Nuke.
