class Context(object):
    """
    A context instance is used to collect a set of key fields describing the
    current Context. We sometimes refer to the context as the current work area.
    Typically this would be the current shot or asset that someone is working on.

    The context captures the current point in both shotgun and the file system and context
    objects are launch a toolkit engine via the :meth:`sgtk.platform.start_engine`
    method. The context points the engine to a particular
    point in shotgun and on disk - it could be something as detailed as a task inside a Shot,
    and something as vague as an empty context.

    The context is split up into several levels of granularity, reflecting the
    fundamental hierarchy of Shotgun itself.

    - The project level defines which shotgun project the context reflects.
    - The entity level defines which entity the context reflects. For example,
      this may be a Shot or an Asset. Note that in the case of a Shot, the context
      does not contain any direct information of which sequence the shot is linked to,
      however the context can still resolve such relationships implicitly if needed -
      typically via the :meth:`Context.as_context_fields` method.
    - The step level defines the current pipeline step. This is often a reflection of a
      department or a general step in a workflow or pipeline (e.g. Modeling, Rigging).
    - The task level defines a current Shotgun task.
    - The user level defines the current user.

    The data forms a hierarchy, so implicitly, the task belongs to the entity which in turn
    belongs to the project. The exception to this is the user, which simply reflects the
    currently operating user.

    def as_template_fields(self, template, validate=False):
        """
        Returns the context object as a dictionary of template fields.

        This is useful if you want to use a Context object as part of a call to
        the Sgtk API. In order for the system to pass suitable values, you need to
        pass the template you intend to use the data with as a parameter to this method.
        The values are derived from existing paths on disk, or in the case of keys with
        shotgun_entity_type and shotgun_entity_field settings, direct queries to the Shotgun
        server. The validate parameter can be used to ensure that the method returns all
        context fields required by the template and if it can't then a :class:`TankError` will be raised.
        Example::

            >>> import sgtk
            >>> tk = sgtk.sgtk_from_path("/studio.08/demo_project")

            # Create a template based on a path on disk. Because this path has been
            # generated through Toolkit's folder processing and there are corresponding
            # FilesystemLocation entities stored in Shotgun, the context can resolve
            # the path into a set of Shotgun entities.
            #
            # Note how the context object, once resolved, does not contain
            # any information about the sequence associated with the Shot.
            >>> ctx = tk.context_from_path("/studio.08/demo_project/sequences/AAA/ABC/Lighting/work")
            >>> ctx.project
            {'type': 'Project', 'id': 4, 'name': 'demo_project'}

            >>> ctx.step
            {'type': 'Step', 'id': 1, 'name': 'Light'}

            # now if we have a template object that we want to turn into a path,
            # we can request that the context object attempts to resolve as many
            # fields as it can. These fields can then be plugged into the template
            # object to generate a path on disk
            >>> templ = tk.templates["maya_shot_publish"]
            >>> templ
            <Sgtk TemplatePath maya_shot_publish: sequences/{Sequence}/{Shot}/{Step}/publish/{name}.v{version}.ma>

            >>> fields = ctx.as_template_fields(templ)
            >>> fields
            {'Step': 'Lighting', 'Shot': 'ABC', 'Sequence': 'AAA'}

            # the fields dictionary above contains all the 'high level' data that is necessary to realise
            # the template path. An app or integration can now go ahead and populate the fields specific
            # for the app's business logic - in this case name and version - and resolve the fields dictionary
            # data into a path.


        :param template:    :class:`Template` for which the fields will be used.
        :param validate:    If True then the fields found will be checked to ensure that all expected fields for
                            the context were found.  If a field is missing then a :class:`TankError` will be raised
        :returns:           A dictionary of template files representing the context. Handy to pass to for example
                            :meth:`Template.apply_fields`.
        :raises:            :class:`TankError` if the fields can't be resolved for some reason or if 'validate' is True
                            and any of the context fields for the template weren't found.

        Serializes the context into a string.

        Any Context object can be serialized to/deserialized from a string.
        This can be useful if you need to pass a Context between different processes.
        As an example, the ``tk-multi-launchapp`` uses this mechanism to pass the Context
        from the launch process (e.g. for example Shotgun Desktop) to the
        Application (e.g. Maya) being launched. Example:
