class ShotgunAuthenticator(object):
    """
    The ShotgunAuthenticator is the central object in the Shotgun authentication
    module. It helps you with authentication and login and makes it easy to 
    create and maintain a shotgun connection so that it belongs to a given user.
    It also helps store who the current user is, so that users don't have to log
    in over and over again, but only when needed.
    
    A simple use case scenario would look something like this:
    
        # create an authenticator
        sa = ShotgunAuthenticator()
        
        # Get a user object. If the authenticator system has already 
        # stored a default user belonging to a default shotgun site,
        # it will simply return this. Otherwise, it will pop up a UI
        # asking the user to log in.
        user = sg.get_user()
        
        # now the user object can be used to generate an authenticated
        # Shotgun connection.
        sg =  user.create_sg_connection()
        
        # This connection will automatically monitor itself and in the
        # case the user credentials (session token) that the user object
        # encapsulates expires or become invalid, the shotgun connection
        # instance will automatically pop up a UI, asking the user
        # to type in their password. This typically happens after
        # 24 hours of inactivity.
    
    In addition to the simple code sample, there are a few more concepts:
    
    - User objects are serializable, meaning that you can pass one from
      one process to another, allowing you to maintain an experience where
      a user is authenticated across multiple applications. This is useful
      if you for example want to launch RV from Maya or Maya from the 
      Shotgun Desktop
      
    - The authenticator maintains the concept of a default user - which 
      can be used in order to present good defaults in UIs as well as 
      headless script based authentication flows.
      
    - The API provides methods for authentication where client code
      can request that the user is prompted to log in.
      
    - On the backend, a defaults manager can be specified which implements
      the logic for how various settings are to be stored. This makes 
      it possible to easily customize the behavior of the authenticator
      to work in different scenarios.  

    For more information, please see the individual methods below.
