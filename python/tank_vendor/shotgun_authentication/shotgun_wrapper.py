        #
        # 1) This is the only thread that reads the session token. Nothing to
        #    worry about.
        # 2) Two threads read this value, and both end up in the exception
        #    handler. The first one will take the lock in renew_session while
        #    the other wil wait. Once the first once updates the session token
        #    on the user, unlocks and the second thread gets the lock, the
        #    comparison will show that the token did indeed get updated and will
        #    unlock.
        # 3) One thread gets the authentication error and goes as far as updating
        #    self.config.session_token, but not before another thread has
        #    initialized original session token with thenold value. Since
        #    self.config.session_token is now valid at the time of the
        #    _call_rpc call, there is no problem.
