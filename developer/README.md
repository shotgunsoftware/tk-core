## How to upgrade pyyaml

This package is a vendor widely used by `sgtk` to parse configuration files
in YAML format.

This package is shipped in source format, that means that only `*.py` are
included in `python/tank_vendor/yaml` for python versions 2.7 and 3.

If you need to upgrade this package you can use the script `upgrade_pyyaml.py`.

```shell
cd tk-core/developer
python upgrade_pyyaml.py
```


## The requirements.txt file

The file `developer/requirements.txt` is not used to install any packages,
however exists so that automated checks for CVEs in dependencies will know about
bundled packages in `python/tank_vendor`.

For this reason, it's important to add any newly bundled packages to this file,
and to keep the file up to date if the bundled version of a module changes.
