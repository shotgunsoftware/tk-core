    Creates a Tank Published File in Shotgun.

    Required parameters:

        tk - a Tank API instance

        context - the context we want to associate with the publish

        path - the path to the file or sequence we want to publish. If the
               path is a sequence path it will be abstracted so that
               any sequence keys are replaced with their default values.

        name - a name, without version number, which helps distinguish
               this publish from other publishes. This is typically
               used for grouping inside of Shotgun so that all the
               versions of the same "file" can be grouped into a cluster.
               For example, for a maya publish, where we track only
               the scene name, the name would simply be that: the scene
               name. For something like a render, it could be the scene
               name, the name of the AOV and the name of the render layer.

        version_number - the verison numnber of the item we are publishing.

    Optional arguments:

        task - a shotgun entity dictionary with id and type (which should always be Task).
               if no value is specified, the task will be grabbed from the context object.

        comment - a string containing a description of the comment

        thumbnail_path - a path to a thumbnail (png or jpeg) which will be uploaded to shotgun
                         and associated with the publish.

        dependency_paths - a list of file system paths that should be attempted to be registered
                           as dependencies. Files in this listing that do not appear as publishes
                           in shotgun will be ignored.

        tank_type - a tank type in the form of a string which should match a tank type
                    that is registered in Shotgun.

        update_entity_thumbnail - push thumbnail up to the attached entity

        update_task_thumbnail - push thumbnail up to the attached task

    Future:
    - error handling
    - look at a project level config to see if publish should succeed if Shotgun is down?
    - if Shotgun is down, log to sqlite and try again later?
