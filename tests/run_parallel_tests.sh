# We're not using our test runner defined in run_tests.py, but nose's, do define a bunch of environment
# variable that will help with the execution of the code.
# --processes=-1 processes means as many processes as there are core
# --process-timeouts=60 is set so that we don't have to worry about splitting complex TankTestBase derived
# classes into multiple classes or having to set _multiprocess_can_split_ to tell nose that each test
# inside the TankTestBase can be run in parallel. 60 seconds is double the amount of time it takes to run the
# tests, so it should be enough.
# -e run_integration_tests is to prevent nose to pick up that source file for testing.

# In order to be able to run the tests, you need to install nose first. (pip install nose) and make sure nosetests
# is in your path.
#
# FIXME: The tests can't be run in parallel with Python 2.5 for some reason. You need to pip install multiprocessing
# first and even then it crashes immediately.
