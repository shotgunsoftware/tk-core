    Tests that it's possible to run bootstrap more than once.
    (Bug https://github.com/shotgunsoftware/tk-core/pull/643)

    This test will bootstrap into the project with an engine that doesn't exist
       - Core is swapped by bootstrap
       - TankMissingEngineError is raised
       - We catch it and attempt to launch an engine that does exist

    This is a subtle bug caused by the fact that the core swap may
    cause equality tests to fail. These can be reintroduced by local
    python imports so it's import to guard against these via tests.

    An innocent `isinstance()` or `except ExceptionClass` may end up
    returning the wrong thing because the core swap has swapped out
    the underlying classes but local imports have caused that the
    old code is still present in the system.
