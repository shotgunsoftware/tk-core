      # Windows's batch file processor reads one unbuffered line from the .bat at a time,
      # which means that if we replace the file while it is being executed, the
      # processor will pick up at the exact same byte position. This is very bad
      # for us because `tank core` can update the content of those .bat
      # files. If we fix the current whitespace issues in those .bat files,
      # then the parser will start reading "mid-line" into the new file
      # and give a parsing error. So do not clean up the file!
      # FIXME: We should update out .bat files so that nothing executes after them
      # so an update is not dangerous.
