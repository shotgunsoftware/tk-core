Welcome to the Shotgun pipeline toolkit!

This command lets you control Toolkit from a shell. You can start apps and
engines via the Tank command. You can also run various admin commands.


General options and info
----------------------------------------------
- To show this help, add a -h or --help flag.
- To display verbose debug, add a --debug flag.
- To provide a script name and script key on the command line for
  authentication, add the --script-name=scriptname and
  --script-key=scriptkey arguments anywhere on the command line.
- To provide a script user and script key in a file for authentication,
  add the --credentials-file=/path/to/credential/file anywhere on the
  command line. The credentials file should be in the YAML format with keys
  script-name and script-key set. For example:
  script-name: Toolkit
  script-key: cb412dbf815bf9d4c257f648d9ec996722b4b452fc4c54dfbd0684d56fa65956


Executing Commands
----------------------------------------------
Syntax: tank [context] command [args]

 - Context is a location on disk where you want the command to operate.
   It can also be a Shotgun Entity on the form Type id or Type name describing
   the object you want to operate on. If you leave this out, the command
   will use your current working directory as the context.

 - Command is the engine command to execute. If you leave this out then the
   available commands will be listed.

Examples:

Show what commands are available for the current directory:
> tank

Show what commands are available for Shot ABC123
> tank Shot ABC123

Show what commands are available for Shot ABC123 in project Flash
(In case you have several projects with a Shot ABC123. Note that this
 only works when running from a tank studio command)
> tank Shot Flash:ABC123

Show a list of all shots in Shotgun containing the phrase ABC
> tank Shot ABC

Launch maya for your current path (assuming this command exists):
> tank launch_maya

Launch maya for a Shot in Shotgun:
> tank Shot ABC123 launch_maya

Launch maya for a Task in Shotgun using an id:
> tank Task @234 launch_maya

Launch maya for a folder:
> tank /studio/proj_xyz/shots/ABC123 launch_maya

Log out of the current user (no context required):
> tank logout
