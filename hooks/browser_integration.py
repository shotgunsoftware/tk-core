        Builds a list of dictionaries matching the kwargs expected by the
        Shotgun Python API's find method. These will be queried at the time
        when a contents state hash is generated during cache population or
        lookup. This hash is then used to verify that the data found in the
        cache is still valid. Customization of this method's logic can be
        used to control what determines whether cached data is valid or not.

        cached.
