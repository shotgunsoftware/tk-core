This hook is a simple example to illustrate how template settings in an app
can be evaluated at runtime based on complex conditions.

If you have an app which has a template parameter, you would typically use a setting
which points to one of your templates. So in the environment config, you would have::

    template_snapshot: maya_shot_publish

However if you want more complex behavior, it is possible to specify that a hook
should be used to evaluate the setting at runtime rather than just set it.
For example::

    template_snapshot: "hook:example_template_hook:maya_shot_publish"

This setting would look for a core hook named ``example_template_hook`` and execute it.
See below for an example implementation and parameter descriptions.
"""

from tank import Hook


class ExampleTemplateHook(Hook):

    def execute(self, setting, bundle_obj, extra_params, **kwargs):
        """
        Example pass-through implementation. One option is expected in ``extra_params``
        and it will be returned.

        So the following two things will evaluate to the same thing:

        > template_snapshot: maya_shot_publish
        > template_snapshot: hook:example_template_hook:maya_shot_publish

        :param setting: The name of the setting for which we are evaluating
                        In our example above, it would be template_snapshot.

        :param bundle_obj: The app, engine or framework object that the setting
                           is associated with.

        :param extra_params: List of options passed from the setting. If the settings
                             string is "hook:hook_name:foo:bar", extra_params would
                             be ['foo', 'bar']

        returns: needs to return the name of a template, as a string.
        """
        template_name = extra_params[0]
        return template_name
