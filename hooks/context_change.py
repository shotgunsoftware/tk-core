    - If an engine **starts up**, the ``current_context`` passed to the hook
      methods will be ``None`` and the ``next_context`` parameter will be set
      to the context that the engine is starting in.

    - If an engine is being **reloaded**, in the context of an engine restart
      for example, the ``current_context`` and ``next_context`` will usually be
      the same.

    - If a **context switch** is requested, for example when a user switches
      from project to shot mode in Nuke Studio, ``current_context`` and ``next_context``
      will contain two different context.

    .. note::

       These hooks are called whenever the context is being set in Toolkit. It is
       possible that the new context will be the same as the old context. If
       you want to trigger some behavior only when the new one is different
       from the old one, you'll need to compare the two arguments using the
       ``!=`` operator.
