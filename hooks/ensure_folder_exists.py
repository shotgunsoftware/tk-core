        Creates folders on disk.

        Toolkit bundles call this method when they want to ensure that
        a leaf-level folder structure exists on disk. In the case where customization
        is required, the hook is passed the bundle that issued the original request.
        This should allow for some sophisticated introspection inside the hook.

        The default implementation creates these folders with read/write
        permissions for everyone.
