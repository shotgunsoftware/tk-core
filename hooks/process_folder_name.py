Core hook which handles conversion of shotgun field data into strings.

This hook can be used to control how folders are named on disk given 
a field in shotgun. Should for example spaces be replaced by underscores
or periods when folders are created?

Also this conversion hook may raise exceptions in order to indicate a validation, 
for example if an invalid naming convention is being used.
