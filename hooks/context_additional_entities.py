        Provides a list of additional entity types and task fields to be
        used when populating :attr:`sgtk.Context.additional_entities`

        The method should return a dictionary with two lists:

        **entity_types_in_path** (:class:`list`) - A list of Shotgun entity types
        (ie. CustomNonProjectEntity05) that :meth:`sgtk.Sgtk.context_from_path`
        should recognize and insert into :attr:`sgtk.Context.additional_entities`.

        **entity_types_in_path** (:class:`list`) - A list of Shotgun fields on the ``Task`` entity
        that meth:`sgtk.context_from_entity` should query Shotgun for and
        insert the resulting entities into :attr:`sgtk.Context.additional_entities`.

        The default implementation returns empty lists.
