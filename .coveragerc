# This allows to merge coverage from different disk locations. This is
# needed because when the integration tests run the core is copied
# in many different locations and tank commands are run with them,
# so we need to tell coverage how to match files with different file
# paths.
#
# The first source needs to be a real file path, which in our case
# is the path we get when we run the tests.
# Then, *python/tank is used is to match coverage for all locations
# that do not start with python/tank
